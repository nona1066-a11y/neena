🌙 SleepWell – Smart Sleep Assistant 💤
🧠 About the App

SleepWell is more than just an alarm — it’s a calm companion designed to help you rebuild your relationship with sleep.
It learns your habits, understands your daily rhythm, and suggests the perfect moment to put your phone away and rest.
Instead of shouting at you to wake up, it gently reminds you that rest is not laziness — it’s the start of a better day.
